    "But let's talk about what the actual iterates are. Well, for every feature in my multiple regression model, first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to calculate this partial derivative, with respect to the jth feature. And I'm going to store that,\n",
    "because that's going to be useful in both taking the gradient step as well as monitoring convergence as I wrote here. So this jth partial, we derived it on the previous slide. It has this formed and then my gradient step takes that jth coefficient at timed t and subtracts my step size times that partial derivative. And then once I cycle through all the features in my model, then I'm gonna increment this t counter. I'm gonna check whether I've achieved convergence or not. If not I'm gonna loop through, and I'm gonna do this until this condition, this magnitude of my gradient is less than epsilon."
