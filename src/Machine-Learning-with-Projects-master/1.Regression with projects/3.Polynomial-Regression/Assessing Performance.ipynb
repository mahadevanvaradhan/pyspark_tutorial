Or lots and lots of other things that we can't ever perfectly capture with just some function between square feet and value, and so that is the noise that's inherent in this process represented by this epsilon term ($\\epsilon$).

And so this is referred to as the variance of this noise term epsilon. And this is something that's just a property of the data. We don't have control over this. This has nothing to do with our model nor our estimation procedure, it's just something that we have to deal with.

So in this context, when we're looking at the variability of these functions at xt, we're taking the expectation and our random quantity is our estimated function for a specific training data set at $x_t$. \n",

I look at that quantity squared and what is my expectation taken over? \n",
    "\n",

    "training data sets of size N. So that's my variance term. \n",
    "\n",
    "And when we think intuitively about why it makes sense that we have the sum of these three terms in this specific form. Well what we're saying is variance is telling us how much can my specific function that I'm using for prediction. I'm just gonna use one of these functions for prediction. I get a training dataset that gives me an $f_{\\bar w}$ (f sub w hat), I'm using that for prediction. Well, how much can that deviate from my expected fit over all datasets I might have seen. \n",

    "So again, going back to our analogy, I'm a real estate agent, I grab my data set, I fit a specific function to that training data. And I wanna know well, how wild of a fit could this be relative to what I might have seen on average over all possible datasets that all these other realtors are using out there? \n",
    "\n",
    "And so of course, if the function from one realtor to another realtor looking at different data sets can vary dramatically, that can be a source of error in our predictions. But another source of error which the biases is capturing is over all these possible datasets, all these possible realtors. If this average function just can never capture anything close to their true relationship between square feet and house value, then we can't hope to get good predictions either and that's what our bias is capturing. And why are we looking at bias squared? Well, that's putting it on an equal footing of these variance terms because remember bias was just the difference between the true value and our expected value. But these variance terms are looking at\n",
    "these types of quantities but squared. So that's intuitively why we get bias squared and then finally, what's our third sense of error? \n",

    "Well let's say, I have no variance in my estimator always very low variance. And the model happens to be a very good\n",

And I guess here I can mention when I take this expectation over training data and my observation Y. Does the observation Y appear anywhere in here, F minus F hat? No, so I can get rid of that Y there. If I look at this I'm repeating it here on this next slide where I have the expectation over my training data of my true function, which I had on the last slide\n",
    "just been denoting as simply F. And the estimated function which I had been denoting, let me be clear it's inside this square that I'm looking at I'd been denoting this as F hat. And both of these quantities were evaluated specifically at $x^t$. \n",

    "$$= E_{train}[((f_{w(true)}(x_t) - f_{\\bar w}(x_t)) + (f_{\\bar w}(x_t) - f_{\\hat w(train)}(x_t)))^2]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again let's go through expanding this, where in this case, when we rewrite this quantity in a way that's gonna be useful for this derivation, we're gonna add and subtract $f_{\\bar w}$  (F sub W bar) and what $f_{\\bar w}$, remember that it was the green dashed line in all those bias variance plots. What $f_{\\bar w}$ is looking average over all possible training data sets, where for each training data set, I get a specific fitted function and I average all those fitted functions over those different training data sets. That's what results in F sub W bar. It's my average fit that for my specific model that I'm getting\n",
    "averaging over my training data sets. And so for simplicity here, I'm gonna refer to $f_{\\bar w}$ as $\\bar f$.\n",
    "- $f_{\\bar w} = \\bar f$\n",

    "Using that same trick of taking the expectation of A plus B squared and completing the square and then passing the expectation through, I'm going to do the same thing here\n",

    "\n",
    "Now let's go through and talk about what each of these quantities is. \n",
    "\n",
    "- And the first thing is let's just remember that $\\bar f$ what was the definition of $\\bar f$  formerly? It was my expectation over training data sets of $\\hat f$ of my fitted function on a specific training data set. I've already taken expectation over the training set here. F is a true relationship. F has nothing to do with the training data. This is a number. This is the mean of a random variable, and it no longer has to do with the training data set either. I've averaged over training data sets. Here there's really no expectation over trending data sets. Nothing is random in terms of the trending data set for this first quantity. So $\\bar f = E_{train}[\\hat f]$\n",
    "\n",
    "- This first quantity is really simply $(f - \\bar f)^2$, and what is that? That's the difference between the true function and my average, my expected fit. Specifically at $x_t$, but squared. That is bias squared. That's by definition. So $$E_{train}[(f - \\bar f)^2] = (f - \\bar f)^2 = bias^2(\\hat f)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's look at this second term, and the second term is not a function of training data. So, this is just like a scaler. It can just come out of the expectation so for this second term I can rewrite this as \n",
    "$$2E_{train}[(f - \\bar f)(\\bar f - \\hat f)] \\\\\n",
    "= 2(f- \\bar f) E_{train}[\\bar f - \\hat f]$$\n",
    "\n",
    "- Okay. And now let's re-write this term, and just pass the expectation through. And the first thing is again $\\bar f$ is not a function of training data, so the result of that is just f bar and then i'm gonna get minus the expectation over my training data of f hat. \n",
    "$$E_{train}[\\bar f - \\hat f] = \\bar f - E_{train}[\\hat f]$$\n",
    "- So, what is this $E_{train}[\\hat f]$? This is the definition of f bar. This is taking my specific fit on a specific, so it's the fit on a specific training data set at $x_t$ And it's taking the expectation over all training data sets. That's exactly the definition of what f bar is, that average fit. \n",
    "$$E_{train}[\\hat f] = \\bar f$$\n",

    "= \\bar f - E_{train}[\\hat f] \\\\\n",
    "= \\bar f - \\bar f \\\\\n",
    "= 0$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That just leaves one more quantity to analyze and that's the last term here where what I have is an expectation over a function minus it's mean squared. So, let me just write this in words. It's an expectation of let's just say, so the fact that I can\n",
    "equivalently write this as F hat minus F bar squared. I hope that's clear that the negative sign there doesn't matter. It gets squared. They're exactly equivalent. And so what is this? \n",
    "- $\\hat f$: this is a random function at $x_t$ which is equal to just a random variable. \n",
    "- $\\bar f$: and this is its mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "And so the definition of taking the expectation of some random variable minus its mean squared, that's the definition of variance. So, this term is the variance of f hat.\n",

We're gonna see this in all different aspects of machine learning, where we have to specify our model and then we need to assess the performance of that model.
